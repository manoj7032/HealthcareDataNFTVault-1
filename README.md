### Features

#### 1. Patient Data Minting
- Tokenize sensitive patient data into Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).
- Mint NFTs with the following attributes:
  - **Token ID**: A unique identifier for each NFT.
  - **Data Type**: The type of healthcare data (e.g., Bloodwork, X-ray, MRI).
  - **Date**: The date of record entry or diagnosis.
  - **Provider**: The name of the healthcare provider or institution.
  - **Encrypted Healthcare Data**: Encrypted sensitive information to ensure privacy.
  - **Image**: Upload relevant healthcare images or reports (e.g., X-rays or MRI scans).
- **Encryption Mechanism**:
  - Uses CryptoJS to encrypt patient data before uploading it to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
  - Ensures that only authorized users with the decryption key can access the data.

#### 2. Secure Storage on IPFS
- Leverages the Pinata API to securely store encrypted healthcare data on the decentralized IPFS network.
- Links the NFT metadata (such as `dataType`, `date`, `provider`, and `imageUrl`) to the IPFS hash for secure referencing.
- Ensures that sensitive data is not stored on-chain, reducing gas costs and improving privacy.

#### 3. Access Control Management
- Provides robust mechanisms for granting and revoking access to NFTs:
  - **Grant Access**:
    - Token owners can securely grant access to other users (e.g., doctors) by providing an encrypted key specific to the recipient.
    - Emits an `AccessGranted` event on the blockchain for traceability.
  - **Revoke Access**:
    - Token owners can revoke previously granted access.
    - Deletes the encrypted access key and emits an `AccessRevoked` event for accountability.
- Validates that only token owners can manage permissions.
- Keeps a record of all users with access permissions for specific tokens.

#### 4. Data Viewing and Decryption
- Allows authorized users to decrypt and view healthcare data securely:
  - Verifies access permissions using encrypted keys stored on-chain.
  - Fetches encrypted healthcare data from IPFS.
  - Decrypts the data using the user's private decryption key.
- Provides a seamless and user-friendly interface for authorized users to view the following:
  - **Healthcare Data Details**: Token ID, data type, date, provider, and encrypted data.
  - **Uploaded Images**: Displays medical images or reports linked to the NFT.

#### 5. User-Friendly Interface
- Built with React.js for a seamless and interactive user experience:
  - **Patient Data Entry Tab**: Mint NFTs and upload data.
  - **Access Control Tab**: Manage access permissions (grant or revoke access).
  - **Doctor View Tab**: View and decrypt healthcare data securely.
  - **Records Overview Tab**: View statistics and metadata of all minted records.
  - **Privacy Laws Tab**: Educates users on healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, HITECH Act).

#### 6. Comprehensive Statistics and Insights
- Provides a detailed overview of NFT records:
  - Total number of NFTs minted.
  - Breakdown by data type (e.g., X-ray, Bloodwork, etc.).
  - Records grouped by provider and date.
- Offers data insights using visual analytics to track healthcare record trends.

#### 7. Compliance with Privacy Regulations
- Designed with privacy laws and compliance in mind:
  - Ensures healthcare data is encrypted and accessible only to authorized users.
  - Meets key requirements of regulations like HIPAA, GDPR, and HITECH Act.

#### 8. Integration with Ethereum Blockchain
- Utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to ensure immutability and transparency.
- Supports interactions via MetaMask for seamless blockchain connectivity.
- Deployable on local Ethereum test networks (e.g., Ganache) or public testnets (e.g., Holesky Testnet).

#### 9. Holesky Testnet Integration
- Offers a test environment for blockchain deployment and testing.
- Enables users to interact with smart contracts on a public blockchain without incurring real gas fees.

#### 10. Robust Error Handling and Validation
- Implements detailed logging and error handling for smooth user experience:
  - Detects and resolves decryption issues.
  - Validates token ownership and access permissions.
  - Handles RPC errors and MetaMask integration seamlessly.
